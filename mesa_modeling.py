"""
Agent-Based Model for a Peer-to-Peer Lending Market Simulation

This simulation uses the Mesa library to model the behavior of borrowers and lenders
in a decentralized lending market. The model is designed based on the document that
describes the lending platform attributes, agent (borrower and lender) attributes, platform
rules, loan request/approval process, and initial conditions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

Key features include:
    - Dynamic interest rate adjustment based on platform liquidity utilization.
    - Auction-based loan matching between borrowers and lenders.
    - Agent decision-making that incorporates risk assessment, reputation, and liquidity management.
    - Simulation of market volatility that affects repayment behavior.
    - Graphical visualization of key statistics for research analysis.

This environment is designed to help explore how different agent strategies, 
incorporating risk assessment and reputation, impact market stability and efficiency.
