# Simulating DeFi Peer-to-peer lending platforms using agent-based modeling
## The Rise of Alternative Lending Platforms
* Accessibility: Alternative lending platforms expand credit access to borrowers who have difficulties obtaining loans from traditional lenders. 
* Efficiency and Cost Savings: Platforms reduce operational costs by removing the need for intermediaries, lowering prices for consumers. 
* Transparency: DeFi lending platforms operate on the blockchain, providing transparency for all participants.

## Project Description
Use emerging machine learning and agent-based modeling techniques to analyze market dynamics of emerging P2P lending platforms and identify risk factors in peer-to-peer lending markets. 

## Project Goals
* Develop Default Prediction Models: Implement machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, to determine key predictors of default risk from real data.
  * This work was done in a separate repository which can be found (here)[https://github.com/whong10/P2P-Loan-Risk-Modeling].
* Engineer an Agent-Based Simulation of P2P Lending: Utilize the Mesa library to model different incentive decision-making calculus between lenders and borrowers to observe environment interactions (this repository).
